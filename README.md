# FAQ

## But this breaks Freedom 0!

Yes, this license breaks Freedom 0: The freedom to run the program for any purpose.

It breaks them on purpose. In lots of countries freedom of speech does not include
hate speech. And I don't think that the freedom to run my code should also mean
that it's totally okay to use software I create in a predator drone to kill people.

## Is this license compatible with the GPL?

No, it breaks Freedom 0. On purpose.

## But you can't enforce the do no harm

It depends. But I want to make a stand and show where I draw the line what I
think is okay.

## Can't you clarify what "harmed" means?

No. I don't want that. Everyone should know what that means.

## Why two different licenses ?

Some people don't want to harm every living being. Some just care about
humans. It's up to you what you want to use.

## But there is already a Do no Evil License!

The [Do-No-Evil License](http://www.noevils.org/licenses/donoevil-1.0.html) just says do no evil.
But evil is even more vague than the harm clause used here. It's up to you what you want to use.
